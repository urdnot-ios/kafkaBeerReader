# kafkaBeerReader

A silly project that is part of my ongoing series of home-sensor data collection. This acts as a bridge between Kafka (running on 3 Raspberry Pi's) and InfluxDb. 
The data comes from a Raspberry Pi that has a flow meter attached and is connected to my Kegerator. 
It provides JSON parsing and data cleanup.

This is not to track my beer consumption, instead it provides data to tell me when I need to go get another keg!
